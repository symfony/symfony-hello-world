Symfony Hello World Edition
===========================

Symfony Hello World Edition is the Symfony distribution you want to use when
doing "Hello World" benchmarks.

It consists of one script (`optimize.sh`) that you need to run to get a fresh
Symfony Standard Edition optimized for raw performance benchmarks.

Benchmark Symfony by getting the `/app.php/hello/world` URL.
